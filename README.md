## Assignment 4

For ease of playtesting, you shoudl select the "Host as Mouse" option, as it will provide a third person view of the map, making details easier to see. 

Physics Constructs:
* Collision with CrumbleWall Object
* Particle system of mesh objects that also have physics collisions

Lights:
* Spot lights highlighting the billboard with the serious question
* Point light and emisssive texture on collectables

Billboard: 
* On the wall where the players start, asks the serious question.

The spot lights serve to highlight the serious question, so the players have it in their minds as they play. The point lights and emssive textures on the collectables, along with the darkened skybox, highlights the collectable locations. This is particularly relevant for the cat player, who can see when a mouse collects a collectable with greater constrast. It also serves to guide mouse players through the maze. The crumbling walls, then, block some of this light for the mice, so that they may not know from too far of a distance if they have chosen a route with or without a collectable.
